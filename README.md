## Earthquake Visualization Project

## Overview

This project involves visualizing earthquake data using Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. The goal is to plot earthquakes on the map based on their longitude, latitude, magnitude, and depth. Additionally, an optional challenge is provided to incorporate tectonic plates data to study the relationship between tectonic movements and seismic activity.

## Files

Module 15 Challenge files: Essential files provided to start the project.
## Create the Earthquake Visualization

## Steps to Complete
1- Data Acquisition:
- Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed to select and download the earthquake data for visualization.
- Use the JSON URL provided by USGS to import data into the visualization script.
2- Map Creation:
- Implement a Leaflet map to visualize the earthquakes.
- Utilize markers to represent the magnitude of earthquakes and color coding to indicate depth.
- Include popups to show detailed information about each earthquake.
- Add a legend to the map for better understanding of the magnitude and depth indicators.
3- Visualization Output:
- Ensure the final map is interactive, with functionalities as specified.
